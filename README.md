##Tic-Tac-Toe
###Expecataions:


The app will consist of two activities. The first is the main menu which takes in the player names and displays the winner of the most recent game.

The second activity is the game itself. It has text that displays whose turn it currently is, and who the winner is once the game is over. Below that is the game board, where each player touches a square to place their letter.

###Requirements:

- Pass the player names from  to 1 in an Intent
- Save the winner of the game in SharedPreferences
- Display the winner of the previous game in MainActivity, which is stored in SharedPreferences
- Complete the Tic-Tac-Toe game
